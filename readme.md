Rdio - Spotify Artist Follow
============================

This script will match the artists you follow on Rdio to artists on Spotify, and then uses the Spotify api to follow the artists. It also displays their "follow" widgets to help you confirm which ones you're following.

### Steps

1. Download this repo from git
2. Download and [install Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/)
3. Open terminal and change dir to the repo on your local hard drive
4. Run "npm install"
5. Run "node artistmatch"

A web page should appear from Rdio asking if you trust this app. Click accept. Shortly after the script will run and a new webpage will return with all the follow widgets embeded. Let the clicking ensue.
